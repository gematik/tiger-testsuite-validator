## Constraints

* Feature file names must be unique in the suite, so having two files in different folders with the same name is NOT supported
* Datatables are not checked for unmodified values in reports
* @Mandatory and @Optional Tags are to be assigned to specific Scenarios. If @Mandatory is added to a feature, then all Scenarios are marked as @Mandatory implicitly. Scenarios marked explicitly with @Optional stay optional though.
* Annotations in Example sections are ignored for the validity check
